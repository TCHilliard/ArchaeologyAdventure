# ArchaeologyAdventure
This is a create-your-own-adventure game created with Twine 2.0 and delivered to the Ocean County Deparment of Parks and Recreation of New Jersey. This Twine was created to meet the requirements of a professional development program, the Institute of Digital Archaeology, hosted by Michigan State University between August 2015 and August 2016.
